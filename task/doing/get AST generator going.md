Get AST generator going
=======================

Not working yet.
Get working.


Splitters
---------

Got the document-to-line splitter working last night.
I think anything that requires recombining lines can be done at later stages so this is no problem right now.
Not sure if I actually need to preserve the lineends in the AST - can do that if needed.

Next I'll split lines into indentation and statements
